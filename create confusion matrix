# compute measures like precision and recall to understand the efficiency of this model.
# To do this, we must start by creating a confusion matrix which aggregates our predictions into a matrix. Each column and row in the matrix will represent observations and predictions for the 3 origins.

origins_observed = test['origin'].values

# initiate the confusion matrix
confusion = pandas.DataFrame(np.zeros(shape=(unique_origins.shape[0], unique_origins.shape[0])), index=unique_origins,           columns=unique_origins)
