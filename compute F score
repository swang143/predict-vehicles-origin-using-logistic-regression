# For the multiclass case, an F score is computed per class then averaged over each
# F-score is a weighted measure of precision and recall defined as: 
Fi = 2 * precison(i) * recall(i)/(precision(i) + recall(i)) for class i.

# For the multiclass, F score is computed per class and then average over each other. This measure is used to find a balance between precision and recall while allowing for comparision against other models.
